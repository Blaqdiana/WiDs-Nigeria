![image](https://github.com/Blaqdiana/WiDs-assignment/assets/109005502/48b88502-b329-440e-9ae4-b094608557e0)

# Project Description:
Develop a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn from a telecom service. 
Utilize machine learning algorithms to train your model on historical data and implement data cleaning, preprocessing, and 
feature engineering techniques.

## Project Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to predict customer churn within a telecom company. By identifying customers who are likely 
to leave the service, the company can take proactive measures to retain them.

**Dataset:**
The dataset contains information about telecom customers, including features like contract type, monthly charges, total charges,
and customer demographics. It also includes a categorical target variable indicating whether a customer churned or not.

You can find the dataset here: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data)

### Project Workflow:
***Data Acquisition:***
  * Obtain the dataset from the provided link: Telco Customer Churn Dataset.

***Data Cleaning:***
  * Preprocess and clean the raw data to ensure its quality and consistency.
  * Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  * Encode categorical variables if necessary.

***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Visualization:*** 
  * Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions.
  * Visualize key variables related to churn.

***Feature Selection and Engineering:***
  * Identify relevant features that may impact churn.
  * Create new features if needed.

***Model Building:***
  * Split the data into training and testing sets.
  * Train machine learning models on the training data.

***Model Evaluation and Predictions:***
  *  Use the trained model to predict churn for new customers.
  * Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

***Recommendations:***
  * Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn.
