## Project Description:
The House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques project aims to predict the sale prices of residential properties based on various features. By analyzing historical housing data, we’ll develop accurate regression models that can estimate house prices. Whether you’re a data scientist, aspiring analyst, or curious learner, this project provides an excellent opportunity to apply advanced regression techniques.  

## Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques. By analyzing the provided 
dataset, we aim to build accurate models that can estimate the sale prices of residential properties.  
**Dataset:**  
The dataset contains various features related to residential properties, including information about the neighborhood, 
building quality, and amenities. The target variable is the sale price of each house.

### Project Workflow  
***Data Acquisition:***
  * Obtain the dataset from the Kaggle competition: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques.

***Data Preprocessing:***
  * Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
  * Encode categorical variables if necessary.

***Feature Selection and Engineering:***
  * Identify relevant features that impact house prices.
  * Create new features if needed.  

***Model Building:***
  * Split the data into training and testing sets.
  * Encode and transforming categorical data
  * Scale the data
  * Train regression model(s).
  * Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.

***Model Evaluation:***
  * Evaluate model performance using metrics like root mean squared error (RMSE).
  * Fine-tune hyperparameters if needed.
  * Summary and recomendations.

***Data Submission:***
  * Create and submit a new file contaning the predicted values.
