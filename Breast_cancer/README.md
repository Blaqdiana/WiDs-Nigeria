## Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most malignant types of cancers, posing a serious threat to womenâ€™s physical and mental health 
worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset 
provides an opportunity to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset for research in this purposes.    
**Dataset:** 
You can find the dataset here: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) and also from the UCI Machine 
Learning Repository.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) / Data 
### 1. Univariate Visualization:
- **Objective**: Understand the distribution of individual features.
    - Histograms or density plots for each feature .
    - Box plots or violin plots to show feature distributions for benign and malignant cases separately.
    - Bar plots for categorical features.

### 2. Bivariate Visualization:
- **Objective**: Explore relationships between pairs of features.
    - Scatter plots or pair plots to visualize feature pairs.
    - Color points based on the target variable (benign or malignant) to identify separability.
    - Correlation heatmap to show pairwise feature correlations.

### 3. Multivariate Visualization:
- **Objective**: Understand interactions among multiple features.
    - Dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce feature dimensions.
    - Plot reduced-dimensional data, color-coded by the target variable.
    - Clustering plots (e.g., K-Means clusters) to identify groups of similar samples.
