## Project Overview
1. ### Introduction:
   The objective of this project is to employ unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation for a mall dataset. The dataset used for this analysis is the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset, which contains
   information about customers, including features like annual income and spending score.  
   Data Source: Use the [Mall Customer Segmentation dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

2. ### Data Exploration:
   The project begins with loading and exploring the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and assess the structure of the
   data. This step involves handling missing values, checking for outliers, and gaining insights into the characteristics of the customers.

3. ### Unsupervised Machine Learning Models:
   Unsupervised learning models, specifically K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering, are utilized to group customers based on their similarities. These models do not require labeled data and aim to identify natural groupings
   within the dataset. The number of clusters is determined based on the characteristics of the data and objectives (business).

4. ### Cluster Visualization:
   The identified clusters are visualized to gain a better understanding of the customer segments. Visual representations are created to illustrate the relationships and differences between theclusters.
   This step aids in interpreting and communicating the segmentation results effectively.

5. ### Customer Segment Insights:
   Insights are provided for each customer segment based on the clustering results. This involves analyzing the common characteristics within each cluster, such as spending behavior, income levels, or any other relevant features.
   Understanding these segments can assist the mall management in tailoring marketing strategies, enhancing customer experience, and optimizing business operations.

## Conclusion
The objective of this project is to identify the model that provides the most accurate and reliable segmentation for for mall customers.
### Note
* The insights derived from customer segmentation can be valuable for strategic decision-making, allowing the mall to personalize services and promotions, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business performance.
